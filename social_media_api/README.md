The goal of this project is to create an API 
for a social media platform where users can interact with each other 
through posts and by following one another. The API will allow users
to create, update, and delete posts, follow other users, and view a feed 
of posts from users they follow. The system will use Django for the backend, 
leveraging its ORM for database interactions, and it will be deployed on PythonAnywhere for accessibility.
